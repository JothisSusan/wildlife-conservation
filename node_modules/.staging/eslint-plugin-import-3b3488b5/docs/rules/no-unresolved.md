# import/no-unresolved

Ensures an imported module can be resolved to a module on the local filesystem,
as defined by standard Node `require.resolve` behavior.

See [settings](../../README.md#settings) for customization options for the resolution (i.e.
additional filetypes, `NODE_PATH`, etc.)

This rule can also optionally report on unresolved modules in CommonJS `require('./foo')` calls and AMD `require(['./foo'], function (foo){...})` and `define(['./foo'], function (foo){...})`.

To enable this, send `{ commonjs: true/false, amd: true/false }` as a rule option.
Both are disabled by default.

If you are using Webpack, see the section on [resolvers](../../README.md#resolvers).
